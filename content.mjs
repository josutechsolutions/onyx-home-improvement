        a: ['A typical residential replacement runs three to five days from excavation to finished surface. Larger or steeper driveways, poor access, and drainage correction all add time. Weather is the biggest variable — asphalt in particular cannot be laid properly in the wet or the cold, and we would rather wait a few days than lay a surface that will not hold.'] },

        a: ['Asphalt is the least expensive up front, goes down fastest, and is straightforward to resurface later. Pavers cost more initially but individual units lift out and go back without a patch mark, so repairs and utility work do not leave scars. Concrete sits between the two and gives the cleanest uniform surface.', 'We walk through all three against your site, your budget, and how much maintenance you actually want to do — rather than steering you toward one by default.'] },

Overlaying leaves whatever caused the original failure in place underneath, so cracks reflect back through the new surface, often within a couple of seasons. If the base is sound and the problem is genuinely surface-level, we will tell you an overlay is reasonable. More often, the honest answer is that the base is the problem.'] },
      { q: 'When can I drive on it?',
        a: ['A paver driveway is ready as soon as the edging and jointing are finished. New asphalt needs to cure — light traffic after a day or two, and we ask you to keep heavy vehicles and sharp turning off it for longer than that, especially in hot weather. We give you specific timing for your job when we finish.'] },

If the grading around your driveway is sending water the wrong way, replacing the surface without correcting it just buys you a few years before the same failure repeats.

We give you the specific timing for your job when we finish, because it depends on the temperature the week we paved.'] },
      { q: 'Can you resurface instead of replacing?',
        a: ['Sometimes. An overlay works when the base is genuinely sound and the problem is confined to the surface — oxidation, minor cracking, a tired-looking mat. It does not work when the driveway has alligator cracking, potholes, or areas that sink after rain, because those are base failures and they reflect straight back through new asphalt, often within two seasons.', 'We will tell you honestly which one you have. An overlay we know will fail is not a saving.'] },
      { q: 'When should an asphalt driveway be sealcoated?',
        a: ['Not immediately. New asphalt needs to cure and release its oils first, so the first sealcoat should wait roughly six to twelve months. After that, every three to five years is reasonable in this climate. Sealing more often than that does nothing useful and builds up a brittle film that cracks on its own.'] },
      { q: 'Can you pave in winter?',
        a: ['Not reliably. Asphalt has to be laid hot and compacted before it cools, and cold ground pulls the heat out of the mat before the roller can finish its work. We schedule paving into the warmer months and into dry windows, and we would rather move your date than lay a surface that will not hold. Excavation and base work can go ahead in colder weather.'] },

We give you exact dates when the pour is done.'] },
      { q: 'Will my concrete driveway crack?',
        a: ['Concrete shrinks as it cures, and shrinkage has to go somewhere. The job of a control joint is to decide where. Cut at the right spacing and to a quarter of the slab depth, joints give the slab a weak line to crack along, and the crack happens inside the joint where you never see it.', 'What is not normal is random cracking across the field, and that comes from an inadequate base, missing or badly placed joints, reinforcement lying on the ground, or a slab that was poured too wet. Those are all decisions made before the truck leaves.'] },
      { q: 'Concrete or asphalt?',
        a: ['Concrete costs more up front, lasts longer with less attention, stays lighter and cooler underfoot, and takes finishes — broom, exposed aggregate, stamped patterns — that asphalt cannot. It is also rigid, which means it needs a better base and it does not forgive ground movement.', 'Asphalt is cheaper, faster, flexes with the ground, and can be resurfaced later. If you want the lowest price today, asphalt. If you want the surface to still look deliberate in twenty years, concrete.'] },
      { q: 'Can you pour concrete in cold weather?',
        a: ['Yes, with precautions. Concrete does not cure below about 40°F and freezing during the first days does permanent damage, so a winter pour means watching the forecast for a clear window, using the right mix, and protecting the slab with blankets while it sets. We schedule around the weather rather than pretending it does not matter.'] },
      { q: 'Do I need to seal a concrete driveway?',
        a: ['It is worth doing in this climate. A penetrating sealer slows the water absorption that drives freeze-thaw spalling and helps against de-icing salt, which is harder on concrete than winter itself. First application once the slab has cured, then every few years. It is optional; the driveway will not fail without it, but it will age faster.'] },

      { q: 'Are paver driveways strong enough for vehicles?',
        a: ['Yes — interlocking concrete pavers are used on port aprons and bus lanes, which are considerably harder duty than a family car. The strength comes from two things: the units interlock so load spreads sideways into neighbouring pavers instead of punching straight down, and the base under a driveway is built deeper than the base under a patio.', 'What matters is that it was built as a driveway. A paver surface laid on a patio-depth base will rut where the wheels sit, and no paver can compensate for that.'] },
      { q: 'Will weeds grow between the pavers?',
        a: ['Some, eventually, and not from below. Weed seed blows in and germinates in the joint sand at the surface. Polymeric jointing sand, compacted in properly, largely prevents it and is what we use as standard. A few volunteers a year at the edges is normal and pulls out by hand.'] },
      { q: 'What happens if a paver gets stained or damaged?',
        a: ['You replace that paver. This is the real advantage of the material and the reason it holds its value: an oil stain, a cracked unit, or a utility trench across the drive is a repair that lifts out and goes back invisibly. The same events on asphalt or concrete leave a patch you will look at for the rest of the time you own the house.', 'We leave you spare units from the same batch when we finish, so a future repair matches rather than approximately matches.'] },
      { q: 'Do paver driveways sink or shift?',
        a: ['A properly built one moves very little. Settling comes from a base that was not compacted in lifts, from a base that was not deep enough for vehicle loads, or from water travelling under the surface because the grade sends it the wrong way. All three are decided before a single paver is laid.', 'When a paver drive does settle, the fix is genuinely a fix: the field is lifted, the base corrected and recompacted, and the same units reset. You rarely need new material.'] },
      { q: 'How much more do pavers cost than asphalt?',
        a: ['Meaningfully more up front — the excavation is deeper, the base is heavier, and the units are set by hand one at a time. Over twenty years the gap narrows, because pavers do not need resurfacing and repairs do not leave scars. We price both against your actual driveway so you are comparing real numbers rather than averages.'] },

      { q: 'Can you match my existing brick?',
        a: ['Usually, and it is the first thing we look at. Brick sizes and colors have changed over the decades, so a close match often means sourcing a reclaimed or specialty brick rather than picking the nearest thing off a pallet. On an older house we will show you options before ordering, because a mismatch on a front facade is permanent and obvious.'] },
      { q: 'What is repointing, and how do I know if I need it?',
        a: ['Repointing is raking out failed mortar joints and replacing them. You need it when mortar is crumbling, has receded noticeably behind the face of the brick, or you can rake it out with a key. Left alone, open joints let water into the wall, and freeze-thaw does the rest — at which point you are replacing brick rather than mortar.'] },
      { q: 'Will the new mortar match the old?',
        a: ['We mix to match color and tool the joint to the same profile, and on most walls the repair reads as part of the wall within a season. New mortar cures lighter and darkens as it weathers, so there is usually a visible difference for the first few months. We tell you that up front rather than letting you discover it.'] },
      { q: 'Why is there white powder on my brick?',
        a: ['That is efflorescence — mineral salts carried to the surface by water moving through the masonry. It is cosmetic in itself and often washes off, but it is a signal worth reading: it means water is getting into the wall and traveling. If it keeps returning after cleaning, the useful question is where the water is coming in, not how to scrub it off.'] },

        a: ['The crown is the sloped slab across the top of the chimney that sheds water away from the masonry below. When it cracks — and thin, poorly formed crowns crack early — water runs straight down inside the chimney structure. A large share of the chimney damage we are called out to look at started as a failed crown, which is why we assess it first.'] },
      { q: 'How often does a chimney need repointing?',
        a: ['There is no fixed interval; it depends on exposure, the original mortar, and how much weather that face of the house takes. A chimney is the most exposed masonry on the building, so it almost always needs attention before the walls do. The practical answer is to look at it when you notice receding joints, spalling brick faces, or staining on the interior near the fireplace.'] },
      { q: 'I have a stain on the ceiling near the chimney. Is that the chimney?',
        a: ['Often, and the usual culprit is flashing rather than the brickwork. Flashing is the metal that seals the joint between the chimney and the roof, and when it lifts, corrodes, or was poorly detailed to begin with, water gets in at exactly that point. It is worth looking at before you repaint, because the stain will come back.'] },
      { q: 'Why does freeze-thaw damage matter here specifically?',
        a: ['Northern Virginia cycles above and below freezing repeatedly through a single winter rather than staying cold. Water that has soaked into a mortar joint expands each time it freezes and works the joint open a little more. That is why a small crack in November is a noticeably larger one by March, and why timing a repair before winter is worth doing.'] },

  },
  {
    q: 'How long has Onyx been in business?',
    a: ['We have been serving homeowners across Northern Virginia since 2010. Onyx is family-operated — you deal with the owners directly, not a salesperson, and the same people who quote the job are on site while it is being built.'],
  },
  {
    q: 'What areas do you serve?',
    a: ['Fairfax, Vienna, Falls Church, Arlington, Alexandria, McLean, Tysons, Reston, Burke, Fairfax Station, Springfield, Annandale, and Clifton in Virginia, plus Washington, DC. If you are just outside that list, call and ask — we often can.'],
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does a typical project take?',
    a: ['It depends heavily on scope and weather. A front walkway or set of steps is often two to three days. A full driveway replacement usually runs three to five. Larger patios, retaining walls, and multi-part projects take longer, and we give you a realistic schedule with the estimate rather than an optimistic one.'],
  },
  {
    q: 'What affects the price of a masonry project?',
    a: ['Square footage, material choice, site access, how much excavation and base work is needed, and any drainage that has to be corrected. Access is the factor homeowners tend to underestimate — a backyard that equipment cannot reach changes the labor considerably. We break all of this out in the estimate so you can see where the money goes.'],
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you clean up at the end of each day?',
    a: ['Yes. Job site cleanliness is something we take seriously, and it comes up repeatedly in our reviews. You should be able to use your property while a project is in progress.'],
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you handle drainage as part of a project?',
    a: ['Yes, and in most cases we insist on it. Water is the reason most masonry and paving fails early. If your existing drainage is contributing to the problem we are being asked to fix, we will tell you and include the correction in the scope.'],
